# Explore Meaning

The purpose of this project is to map a dictioanry to determine which root words are used to define other words.

The objective is to discover what core concepts are the building blocks for "meaning."

Humans learn language through first connecting sensory input signals to "nouns" within the world.

They then learn to qualify these nouns or relate them through adjectives and verbs. 

There should be some core set of building blocks that we use to define the world around us.

Ultimately, our goal should be to find the absolute language of the universe (to describe meaning as directly as possible). Human language is just a translation of this base level meaning to enable us to pass meaning from person to person.
